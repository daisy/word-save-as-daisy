        <p>Unfortunately, people tend to learn by their own mistakes. And now, when the ozone layer is considerably damaged, the ocean level has risen and earthquakes are shaking the planet, we start doubting, may be it is <em>our</em> fault. But these signs are still not enough for us, we keep on ruining our environment. We build unreliable drilling rigs, we erect nuclear power plants, cut down rainforests and grow genetically modified crops.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>But sometimes we do look ahead. And when we do it, we get terrified and we try to do something to smooth over the consequences of our dangerous experiments. Are these short glimpses enough to save our planet from ourselves? You know whom it depends on. More and more people understand that. And they undertake first modest steps to improve the situation.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Our country is not an exception. This year Belarus took part in the World Car-Free Day for the third time. There are more that 3.5 million cars in the republic and the number is constantly growing. We can only imagine the amount of CO2 all these cars emit daily into the atmosphere. No doubt, people who decided to support the green movement and gave a day off for their cars were in the minority. But still the number of cars that remained on the parking lot on this day exceeded the number of the previous year. This time city authorities created all necessary conditions to encourage car owners to give up their automobiles for one day. Minsk public transport was free for people who had their vehicle registration certificate on them. And even the weather was pretty good to undertake a walk.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Our company eagerly supported the movement. Undoubtedly, not everyone was ready to use their legs according to the intended purpose. But still I’m happy with the result. Actually our company supports the green movement on the regular basis because the majority of our team members daily get to work by bus, on foot or ride a bicycle. And on September 22<sup>nd</sup> many of our car owners left their vehicles at home and stepped on their way to green office. </p>

        <p />
        <level2>
          <h2>  The Maintenance Problem 
</h2>
          <p>Manufacturing Plants, Airports, Refineries, Transportation companies and many other large enterprises have one thing in common: they operate large amounts of assets, which all require regular scheduled maintenance and repair. </p>
          <p />
          <p>An experienced Maintenance Department can do the planning of proactive maintenance and repair for several hundred assets with conventional tools, based on Excel or similar programs. However, if the number of assets reaches or exceeds several 10,000, then it is obvious that this approach would not work any longer.</p>
          <p />
          <p>Taking into account the manufacturers preventive maintenance directives, available manpower resources, tools, spare parts and utilities, distance of asset locations, in competition with mostly always unscheduled urgent repair requests, than it becomes clear that a constraint-based long term maintenance planning tool is needed, taking these requirements into account.</p>
          <p />
          <p />
          <p />
        </level2>
        <level2>
          <h2>  What we can offer
</h2>
          <p>We have experience in developing custom maintenance planning systems for large-scale asset owners (over <strong>200.000</strong> assets). </p>
          <p />
          <p>We know how to read asset data from ERP systems and interact with plant maintenance systems like SAP PM, process preventive maintenance requirements along with available resources and tools, take into account the competing requirement of sudden repairs, and create long term constraint-based work schedules, with work order inputs to the ERP system. </p>
          <p />
          <p>We understand the challenges of plant maintenance requirements of resource, we know resource leveling and the underlying mathematical planning algorithms, and we have the experience to develop enterprise-class software systems.</p>
          <p />
          <p>These are the keys to successful implementation of long-term maintenance planning systems on a large scale. You can download the presentation to learn more about Plant Maintenance System.</p>
